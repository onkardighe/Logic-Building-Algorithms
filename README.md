[Add Program](https://github.com/onkardighe/Logic-Building-Algorithms/projects/1#card-59581971)

## Overview

The repository is a collection of open-source implementation of a variety of algorithms implemented in differrnt programming languages and licensed under [GPLv3 License](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/C/blob/master/LICENSE). The algorithms span a variety of topics from computer science, mathematics and statistics, data science, machine learning, engineering, etc.. The implementations and the associated documentation are meant to provide a learning resource for educators and students. Hence, one may find more than one implementation for the same objective but using a different algorithm strategies and optimizations.
